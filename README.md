## AI-Financial-Market-Data-Analysis
### Overview
This project analyzes synthetic daily financial market data related to companies involved in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The dataset includes key financial metrics and events that influence stock performance, such as product launches
(e.g., Meta's Llama, OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini). The data spans from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024, 
and covers companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
Date: The date of the record (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
Company: The company name (OpenAI, Google, or Meta).
R&D_Spending_USD_Mn: The amount spent on Research & Development (in USD millions).
AI_Revenue_USD_Mn: The revenue generated from AI products and services (in USD millions).
AI_Revenue_Growth_%: The percentage growth in AI revenue compared to the previous period.
Event: Notable events (e.g., product launches) that could impact stock performance.
Stock_Impact_%: The percentage impact on the company's stock due to events or financial performance

### Project Structure

Data Loading and Exploration: Importing libraries, loading the dataset, and initial exploration.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and converting data types.
Visualizations:
Bar plots comparing R&D spending and revenue across companies.
Trends in AI revenue growth over time.

### Key Insights:
Total R&D spending and revenue generated by each company.
Impact of events on stock performance.
